# 🌍 Climate & Air Quality Trends Analysis
## 🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes **climate and air quality trends** using historical and live datasets from multiple sources such as meteorological stations, IoT sensors, and open government data.
The goal is to provide insights into air pollution levels, temperature patterns, and environmental risks over time to support data-driven environmental monitoring and decision-making.
## 🎯 Objectives

- Collect and integrate air quality and climate datasets.

- Perform trend analysis and identify anomalies over time.

- Visualize air quality indices, temperature, humidity, and pollutant levels.

- Correlate climate factors with pollution and seasonal effects.

- Build interactive dashboards for monitoring and decision support.

## 🧠 Key Features

✅ Collects climate and air quality data from multiple sources.

✅ Preprocesses data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
  
✅ Performs statistical and trend analysis on temperature, pollutants, and AQI.

✅ Generates visualizations for spatial and temporal patterns.

✅ Supports predictive modeling of air quality trends.

✅ Deploys interactive dashboards (Power BI / Streamlit) for monitoring.
